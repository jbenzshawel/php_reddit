## PHP Reddit [addison.im/php_reddit](http://addison.im/php_reddit/) 
- This website was made to recreate reddit with a backend in PHP instead of Python 
- The users, posts, and comments class make up the basic functionality for creating posts 
- The page posts/view.php is where pretty much everything takes place 


Note: This is a pretty old repo and the backend needs to be refactored. I eventually plan on either writing my own MVC framework or using the slim microframework to clean things up
