##PHP Reddit
A version of this site is [hosted here](http://addison.im/php_reddit/posts/view.php)

PHP Reddit is a website made to look like reddit, but has a backend written in PHP instead of Python. The classes comments, posts, and users contain the various funcitons that make the blog work.

I plan on working on this when I have time and hope to eventually have a pretty similar site/functionality.
